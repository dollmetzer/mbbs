=======================

What is it?
-----------
This web application is a tiny messaging platform, focussed on private mail and
closed forum functions. The intention was to build up a local and temporary
communication platform for closed groups, e.g. for small exhibitions or congresses.

It's user interface is optimised for access via mobile devices and the program 
code is lightweight enough to run on cheap and tiny devices, like the Raspberry Pi.
